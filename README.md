Java 8, released in March 2014, introduced several significant features and enhancements to the Java programming language. Here are some of the key features introduced in Java 8:


<h1 align="left">Lambda Expressions:</h1>

Lambda expressions enable the functional programming paradigm in Java by providing a concise syntax for defining anonymous functions. They are useful for writing code that can be treated as data and passed around. Lambda expressions are primarily used in conjunction with functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method (SAM). They enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.

<h1 align="left">Functional Interfaces:</h1>

Java 8 introduced the @FunctionalInterface annotation, which indicates that an interface is intended to be used as a functional interface. Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method and are used in conjunction with lambda expressions and method references.

<h1 align="left">Stream API:</h1>

The Stream API provides a powerful and declarative way to process collections of data. Streams allow you to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and sorting on collections in a concise and functional manner. They promote parallel processing and can greatly simplify code that deals with collections.

<h1 align="left">Default Methods:</h1>

Default methods enable interfaces to provide concrete implementations for methods. Prior to Java 8, adding a new method to an interface would require modifying all the classes that implement that interface. With default methods, you can add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking backward compatibility.

<h1 align="left">Method References:</h1>

Method references allow you to refer to a method by its name instead of providing a lambda expression. They provide a more concise way to express certain types of lambda expressions. Method references can be categorized into four types: static method references, instance method references, constructor references, and arbitrary object method references.

<h1 align="left">Optional Class:</h1>

The Optional class is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps to address the issue of null references and NullPointerExceptions. Optional provides methods to handle cases where a value may be absent, promoting safer and more robust code.

<h1 align="left">Date/Time API:</h1>

Java 8 introduced a new date and time API in the java.time package. The new API provides classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Duration, Period, and more, to handle date and time operations in a more intuitive and flexible way compared to the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

<h1 align="left">Default and Static Interface Methods:</h1>

Java 8 allows interfaces to have static and default methods. Static methods in interfaces are similar to regular static methods in classes, while default methods provide a default implementation for methods in interfaces. These features provide more flexibility and allow for better code reuse and evolution of interfaces.
